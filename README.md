Dynamic Pokémon Fetcher is a responsive web application that allows users to search
for any Pokémon by name or ID and view its details in real-time using the PokéAPI. 
Built with HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, the app displays each Pokémon’s 
name, ID, height, weight, base experience, types, and image in a clean and interactive 
card layout. It features a loading indicator, error handling for invalid inputs, and a
fully responsive design that works across all screen sizes. This project demonstrates 
the use of async/await, fetch API, DOM manipulation, and Tailwind utility classes to
create a modern, functional, and visually appealing web interface.
